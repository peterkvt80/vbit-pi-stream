# vbit-pi

## PLEASE NOTE: This project is obsolete and has been replaced by VBIT2

Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/vbit-pi-stream
The Streaming version VBIT-Pi generates a stream of raw teletext transmission data. This can be used by separate process to drive a teletext inserter. 
In this case, the intended inserter is Alistair Buxton's raspi-teletext which uses the video output of a Raspberry Pi to generate teletext without any additional hardware.
The complete installation sets up a Raspberry Pi with VBIT-Pi driving Raspi-Teletext with a small selection of pages.
